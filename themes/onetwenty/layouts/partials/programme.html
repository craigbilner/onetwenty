            Tabata is a high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and each exercise in a given workout only lasts
            four minutes. A workout could look a bit like this:
        </div>
        <ul class="font-light workout-list">
            <li>
                Workout hard for 20 seconds
            </li>
            <li>
                Rest for 10 seconds
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete 8 rounds
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="font-light">
            You push yourself as hard as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set.
            You'll complete eight sets of each exercise.

            Gymnastics workouts increase your strength and flexibility while boosting muscular endurance.
            Much like bodyweight training, it is done without the use of free weights or machines,
            but using your own weight to provide resistance against gravity.
